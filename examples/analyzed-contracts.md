## 1. USDC (Circle USD Coin)
**Address:** `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48`  
**Network:** Ethereum Mainnet  
**TVL:** ~$50 Billion

### Security Score: 65/100

### Key Findings:
- ✅ Contract is verified and audited
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Centralized admin control with upgrade capability
- ⚠️ **HIGH**: Proxy pattern allows implementation changes
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM**: Pausable functionality (admin can freeze transfers)

### Risks Identified:
1. **Admin Control Risk (Critical)**
   - Contract has privileged admin functions
   - Admin can upgrade implementation
   - Single point of failure for $50B+ in value

2. **Upgrade Mechanism (High)**
   - Proxy pattern allows code changes
   - No timelock visible in contract
   - Users must trust Circle's governance

3. **Reentrancy Considerations (Medium)**
   - External calls present in transfer logic
   - State changes should occur before external calls

### AI Insights:
"This is a proxy contract implementing USDC stablecoin. While functionally sound for a stablecoin, the centralized admin control presents systemic risk. The ability to upgrade implementation and pause transfers means users must trust Circle (the issuer) completely. This is acceptable for a centralized stablecoin but contradicts decentralization principles."

## 2. Uniswap V3 Factory
**Address:** `0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984`  
**Network:** Ethereum Mainnet  
**Protocol:** Uniswap V3

### Security Score: 82/100

### Key Findings:
- ✅ No admin keys or upgrade mechanisms
- ✅ Immutable deployment
- ✅ Well-audited codebase
- ✅ Battle-tested with $4B+ TVL

### Risks Identified:
1. **Complexity Risk (Low)**
   - Concentrated liquidity math is complex
   - Potential for edge cases in tick calculations

2. **Integration Risk (Medium)**
   - External protocols must implement correctly
   - Incorrect usage can lead to loss of funds

### AI Insights:
"The Uniswap V3 Factory is a masterclass in immutable, decentralized design. No owner, no upgrades, pure code. The concentrated liquidity mechanism is mathematically sound but complex. The main risks are in how external protocols integrate with it, not in the factory itself."

## 3. Uniswap (UNI) Governance Token
**Address:** `0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984`  
**Network:** Ethereum Mainnet

### Security Score: 75/100

### Key Findings:
- ✅ ERC-20 compliant with governance extensions
- ✅ Delegation system for voting power
- ⚠️ **HIGH**: Controlled minting via privileged minter address
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM**: Minter can be changed via setMinter()

### Risks Identified:
1. **Centralization Risk - Minter Control (High)**
   - Single `minter` address can create new tokens
   - `setMinter()` allows changing this critical role
   - Without multi-sig or DAO control, this is a centralization vector
   - **Mitigation**: mintCap and minimumTimeBetweenMints provide constraints

2. **Economic Risk - Token Inflation (Medium)**
   - Minter can dilute token holders within cap limits
   - Requires trust in entity controlling minter role
   - **Recommendation**: Implement DAO-governed minting process

3. **Signature Replay Risk (Medium)**
   - `permit()` and `delegateBySig()` use nonces
   - Improper nonce management could allow replay attacks
   - **Mitigation**: EIP-2612 compliant implementation needed

### Optimizations:
1. **Checkpoint Storage (Medium Impact)**
   - Historical vote tracking uses checkpoint system
   - Binary search for getPriorVotes could be optimized
   - Consider packed structs for gas efficiency

2. **Event Emissions (High Off-chain Value)**
   - All critical operations emit events
   - Enables efficient off-chain monitoring
   - Good for transparency and governance tracking

### AI Insights:
"UNI token combines standard ERC-20 with Compound-style governance delegation and controlled minting. The architecture is sound, but the centralization of minting authority is a notable trust assumption. The delegation system is well-designed for DAO governance, using checkpoints for historical vote queries. Main concern: ensure `setMinter` is controlled by DAO governance, not a single address."

## 4. AAVE V2 Lending Pool
**Address:** `0x7d2768dE32b0b80b7a3454c06BdAc94A69DDc7A9`  
**Network:** Ethereum Mainnet  
**TVL:** ~$5 Billion

### Security Score: 88/100

### Key Findings:
- ✅ Comprehensive reentrancy guards
- ✅ Oracle price manipulation protection
- ✅ Emergency pause mechanism
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM**: Complex liquidation logic

### Risks Identified:
1. **Oracle Dependency (Medium)**
   - Relies on Chainlink oracles for pricing
   - Oracle failure could impact liquidations
   - Mitigation: Fallback oracle system

2. **Flash Loan Risk (Low)**
   - Flash loans are a feature, not a bug
   - Users must understand MEV implications
   - Protocol has built-in protections

### AI Insights:
"AAVE V2 represents institutional-grade DeFi security. Multiple audits, formal verification, and battle-tested code. The lending pool has comprehensive checks for reentrancy, oracle manipulation, and edge cases. Main consideration: oracle dependency is inherent to lending protocols."

## 5. Compound cUSDC Token
**Address:** `0x39AA39c021dfbaE8faC545936693aC917d5E7563`  
**Network:** Ethereum Mainnet

### Security Score: 85/100

### Key Findings:
- ✅ Well-audited lending market
- ✅ Algorithmic interest rate model
- ✅ Proven track record
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM**: Admin functions for parameter updates

### Risks Identified:
1. **Governance Risk (Medium)**
   - Admin can update interest rate models
   - Requires trust in Compound governance
   - Changes go through timelock

2. **Market Risk (Low)**
   - Utilization-based interest rates
   - High utilization can cause rate spikes
   - This is by design for market equilibrium

### AI Insights:
"Compound's cToken design is elegant and battle-tested. The main risk is not in the code but in governance decisions around parameter updates. The algorithmic interest rate model works well but can surprise users during high utilization periods."

- ⚠️ **HIGH**: Relies on MakerDAO governance
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM**: Multiple authorized minters

### Risks Identified:
1. **System Complexity (High)**
   - DAI is backed by complex collateral system
   - Multiple contracts interact (Vat, Jug, etc.)
   - System-wide risk if one component fails

2. **Governance Risk (Medium)**
   - MKR holders control critical parameters
   - Emergency shutdown capability exists
   - Requires active governance participation

### AI Insights:
"DAI is the most decentralized stablecoin but comes with complexity. The token itself is simple ERC-20, but it's part of a sophisticated system. Main risks are in the broader MakerDAO protocol, not this token contract specifically."

---

## 7. Chainlink Token (LINK)
**Address:** `0x514910771AF9Ca656af840dff83E8264EcF986CA`  
**Network:** Ethereum Mainnet

- ✅ No admin keys or upgrades
- ✅ Immutable deployment

### Risks Identified:
- **None Critical** - Standard ERC-20 with ERC-677 extension
- Low complexity = Low risk

### AI Insights:
"LINK token is a textbook example of secure token design. Simple, immutable, and battle-tested. The ERC-677 transferAndCall extension enables efficient oracle payments without approval transactions."

---

## 8. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)
**Address:** `0x2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599`  
**Network:** Ethereum Mainnet  
**TVL:** ~$8 Billion

- ⚠️ **HIGH**: Minting controlled by custodian
- ⚠️ **HIGH**: Burning controlled by custodian

### Risks Identified:
1. **Custody Risk (Critical)**
   - WBTC is backed by BTC held by BitGo
   - Users trust custodian to maintain reserves
   - Single point of failure for $8B+ in value

2. **Minting Authority (High)**
   - Merchant addresses can mint WBTC
   - Requires trust in merchant vetting process
   - No on-chain proof of reserves

### AI Insights:
"WBTC brings Bitcoin to Ethereum but introduces centralization. The token contract itself is secure, but the system relies entirely on trusted custodians. This is a bridge, not a decentralized solution. Users should understand they're trusting BitGo, not code."

### Risks Identified:
1. **Inflation Schedule (Low)**
   - CRV has programmatic emission
   - Decreasing over time (like Bitcoin)
   - Transparent and predictable

2. **DAO Governance (Medium)**
   - Critical decisions require DAO vote
   - Vote-escrowed CRV (veCRV) for voting
   - Time-locked governance adds security

### AI Insights:
"CRV token implements DeFi 2.0 tokenomics with vote-escrow mechanism. The inflation schedule is transparent and decreasing. Main innovation: veCRV aligns long-term incentives by rewarding token locking for voting power."

## 10. Exploit Example: Reentrancy Vulnerability
**Address:** `[Simulated Vulnerable Contract]`  
**Network:** Testing

### Security Score: 15/100 ⚠️

### Key Findings:
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Reentrancy vulnerability in withdraw()
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No access controls
- ❌ **HIGH**: Integer overflow possible
- ❌ **HIGH**: No checks on external calls

### Vulnerable Code Detected:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    
    // VULNERABLE: External call before state update
    msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    
    // State update after external call
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
}
```

### Attack Vector:
1. Attacker calls withdraw()
2. Receive function calls withdraw() again (reentrancy)
3. Balance not yet updated, passes require check
4. Drains contract

### ChainSage Detection:
✅ **Detected by AI Analysis:**
- "External call before state change"
- "Potential reentrancy in withdraw function"
- "Recommend: Update state before external calls"

### Recommended Fix:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) public nonReentrant {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    
    // State update BEFORE external call
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    
    // External call after state update
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
```
