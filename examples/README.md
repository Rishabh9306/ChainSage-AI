   - ⚠️ Critical: Admin control centralization
   - ⚠️ High: Upgrade vulnerabilities
   - ⚠️ Medium: Reentrancy via upgradeToAndCall
   - Score: 65/100

2. **[Uniswap V3 Router](./uniswap-v3-analysis.txt)** - Leading DEX
   - Analyzed swap logic and fee mechanisms
   - Identified gas optimization opportunities
   - Verified mathematical correctness

3. **AAVE Lending Pool** (Coming soon)
   - Flash loan analysis
   - Liquidation mechanics
   - Oracle dependencies

### 🛡️ Security-Focused

4. **Known Vulnerable Contracts** (Educational)
   - DAO Hack analysis
   - Parity Multisig bug
   - How ChainSage detects these issues

### ⚙️ Infrastructure

5. **Gnosis Safe**
   - Multi-signature wallet analysis
   - Threshold security review

## How to Use These Examples

### For Learning:
```bash
# Read the analysis
cat examples/usdc-analysis.md

# Compare with live data
npx chainsage analyze 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 --network mainnet
```

### For Testing:
```bash
# Run analysis on all examples
for contract in examples/*.md; do
  address=$(grep "Address:" $contract | cut -d' ' -f2)
  npx chainsage analyze $address --network mainnet
done
```

### For Your Contracts:
```bash
# Analyze your contract
npx chainsage analyze YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network YOUR_NETWORK

# Compare with simulation
npx chainsage compare contracts/YourContract.sol YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

## Metrics from These Analyses

| Contract | Score | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
|----------|-------|----------|------|--------|-----|

## Analysis Categories

### ✅ What ChainSage Detects:

- **Access Control**: Admin privileges, ownership transfers
- **Reentrancy**: Cross-function, cross-contract attacks
- **Integer Safety**: Overflow, underflow, precision loss
- **Gas Efficiency**: Optimization opportunities
- **Upgradeability**: Proxy patterns, storage collisions
- **Economic**: Flash loan risks, oracle manipulation
- **Logic Errors**: State inconsistencies, edge cases

### 📊 Analysis Depth:

- **Basic**: Contract structure, functions, events
- **Security**: Vulnerability detection, risk scoring
- **Behavioral**: Transaction patterns, usage analysis
- **Comparative**: Simulation vs reality differences
- **Predictive**: Potential attack vectors

## Real-World Impact
