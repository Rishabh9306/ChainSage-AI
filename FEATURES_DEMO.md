cat > contracts.txt << EOF
0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48
0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7
0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F
EOF

# Run batch analysis
npx chainsage batch contracts.txt -n ethereum -o results.json

# Output includes:
# - Total contracts analyzed

Contract: MyToken

Security Score: 45/100

1. Reentrancy Vulnerability
   Severity: CRITICAL
   The withdraw function allows reentrancy attacks

   Original Code:
   function withdraw(uint amount) public {
       require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
       msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
       balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
   }

   Fixed Code:
   function withdraw(uint amount) public nonReentrant {
       require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
       balances[msg.sender] -= amount; // State change before external call
       (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
       require(success, "Transfer failed");
   }

   Best Practices:
   ‚Ä¢ Use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
   ‚Ä¢ Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
   ‚Ä¢ Always update state before external calls
```
