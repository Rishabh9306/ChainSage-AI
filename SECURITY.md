**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report via one of these methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to [your-security-email@example.com]
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. **Direct Message**: Contact maintainers directly on [Discord/Telegram]

### üìã What to Include

Please include the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies by severity
  - Critical: Within 7 days
  - High: Within 14 days
  - Medium: Within 30 days
  - Low: Next release

- Public acknowledgment in release notes (if desired)
- Listed in SECURITY_HALL_OF_FAME.md
- Potential bug bounty (as program develops)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to Git
   ```bash
   # Always use .env file
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   ```

2. **Network Safety**: Be cautious with mainnet operations
   ```bash
   # Test on testnet first
   npx chainsage analyze ADDRESS --network sepolia
   ```

3. **Updates**: Keep ChainSage updated
   ```bash
   npm update -g chainsage-ai
   ```

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate user inputs
2. **Error Handling**: Never expose sensitive data in errors
3. **Dependencies**: Regularly audit with `npm audit`
4. **Testing**: Write security-focused tests

## Known Security Considerations

### API Key Storage

- API keys are stored in `.env` files (not committed)
- Keys are never logged in plain text
- Use environment-specific keys (dev/staging/prod)

### Network Requests

- All requests use HTTPS
- Timeout mechanisms prevent hanging
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

### AI Analysis

- AI responses are sanitized before display
- No execution of AI-suggested code without review
- Rate limits prevent prompt injection abuse

### Smart Contract Interactions

- Read-only operations by default
- No private key handling in CLI
- Explicit user confirmation for write operations

## Security Audit Status

- ‚úÖ **Code Review**: Internal review completed
- ‚è≥ **External Audit**: Pending
- ‚è≥ **Formal Verification**: Planned for core modules
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Audit**: No critical vulnerabilities

## Security-Related Configuration

### Recommended .env Settings

```bash
# Minimum recommended settings
LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
LOG_LEVEL=info
ENABLE_CACHE=true
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30000
```

### Network Configuration

```bash
# Use your own RPC endpoints for production
MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR-API-KEY
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR-API-KEY
```

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

We follow responsible disclosure:

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported

3. **Day 3**: Assessment complete
4. **Day 7-30**: Fix developed and tested
5. **Day 30**: Fix released
6. **Day 60**: Public disclosure (if appropriate)
